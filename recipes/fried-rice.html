        <h1>Alex's Fried Rice</h1>
        <img src="../images/friedrice.jpg" alt="Picture of fried rice in a wok">

        <p>This is a family favouirte, and is a quick and versatile way of using up any leftovers you may have in the fridge. Easily customisable, you can easily replace the protein to cater to vegetarian or vegan diets. <em>NOTE</em> Although you can use fresh rice, I highly reccomend using day old rice instead so that it turns out dry and crispy insead of soft and soggy.</p>
        <p><h4>Ingredients:</h4></p>
        <p><h5>Fried Rice Ingredients</h5></p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>1 cup of day old rice <em>(We prefer Rooster brand jasmine rice, but any leftovers will do)</em></li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>Around 4 tbsp cooking oil</li>
            <li>3-4 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>1 chicken breast previously cooked <em>(This can be switched with an alternative such as beef or tofu, or omitted completely if you want just egg fried rice)</em></li>
            <li>1/2 cup vegetables <em>(If from frozen, make sure they're thawed and dry)</em></li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp. MSG</li>
            <li>1-2 tbsp. soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 onion diced</li>
        </ul></p>
    <p><h5>Garnish:</h5></p>
    <p><ul>
        <li>1-2 green onion stalks</li>
        <li>Toasted sesame seeds</li>
        <li>Siracha <em>optional</em></li>
    </ul></p>
    <p><h5><strong>Before you start:</strong></h5></p>
    <p>Your wok should be <strong>hot</strong> and ready to cook right away. Gather and prepare your ingredients before heating the wok so you're able to add them without burning anyting.</p>
    <p><h4>Steps:</h4></p>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Add oil to your wok and heat on high until oil is shimmering.</li>
        <li>Add eggs. Oil should be hot enough that they start making curds immediately.</li>
        <li>As eggs firm up, add your garlic and keep stirring until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add your rice and keep stirring to prevent sticking and burning.</li>
        <li>Add in your sugar and MSG, you don't need much of either. It enhances and balances the taste.</li>
        <li>Fry until you smell the rice cooking and the grains are shiny.</li>
        <li>Add the protein and stir.</li>
        <li>Add the veggies and stir.</li>
        <li>Add the soy sauce and stir.</li>
        <li>Add the onion and stir</li>
        <li>Plate in a deep bowl and garnish!</li>
    </ol></p>
