        <p><h4>Ingredients:</h4></p>
        <p><h5>Salad Ingredients</h5></p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>1 cup uncooked quinoa</li>
            <li>1 tsp of better than boulion vegetable flavour</li>
            <li>1/2 tbsp. cumin</li>
            <li>1/2 tbsp. tumeric</li>
            <li>1 tbsp. paprika</li>
            <li>1 cucumber cubed</li>
            <li>1 tomato cubed</li>
            <li>1 bell pepper (red, yellow, or green) cubed</li>
            <li>1 red onion minced</li>
            <li>Fresh cilantro (optional and to taste)</li>
            <li>Fetta cheese (optional and to taste)</li>
        </ul></p>
    <p><h3>Dressing Ingredients</h3></p>
    <p><ul>
        <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 clove of minced garic</li>
        <li>1 tbsp honey</li>
        <li>2 bunches of lemon thym minced</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p><h4>Steps:</h4></p>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Rinse your quinoa with cool water.</li>
        <li>Add your rinsed quinoa to a large saucepan and add two cups of cool water, along with your better than boulion and spices. Bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Once the quinoa is boiling, lower the temperature to medium heat and cover with a lid. Let simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the quinoa has opened up and is tender.</li>
        <li>While the quinoa is boiling, cut your vegeetables and add them to a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Finely chop your fresh herbs and add them to the bowl.</li>
        <li>Add all of the dressing ingredients to a pourable container and mix thoroughly. Keep to the side.</li>
        <li>Once the quinoa is cooked and the water has been absorbed, fluff with a fork and allow it to cool in the pot for roughly 10 minuets. *If there's still water left but your quinoa is cooked, simmer carefully with the lid off while continuously stirring so that the liquid can evaporate and the quinoa won't burn.</li>
        <li>Once the quinoa has cooled, add it to the bowl with your vegetables and herbs.</li>
        <li>Add enough dressing for your taste and mix thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Grab a fork, and enjoy!</li>
