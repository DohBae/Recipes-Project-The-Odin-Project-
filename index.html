        git commit Fix heading error after inserting image

Heading Welcome to my fist website was showing a red error on <h2> 
element, and was positioned beside the website image. > was missing 
after <img src="./images/salad.jpg">. After adding the closing triangle
bracket, header 2 is showing up with proper formatting on it's own 
line.
